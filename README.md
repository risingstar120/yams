YAMS
====

*Yet Another Mpd Scrobbler (For Last.FM)*

YAMS is exactly what its name says it is.


#### Requirements
`PyYAML` and `python-mpd2` are required.

#### Installation
Clone this repo and run `pip3 install -e <path_to_repo>` (omit the `-e` flag if you don't want changes in the repo to be reflected in your local installation)

#### Running

The script includes a `yams` script that should be installed with pip. If not, `python3 -m yams` will do the trick. I recommend running it in the background and following its log output (e.g. `yams &` and then watching the log wiht `tail -F ~/.config/yams/yams.log`).

#### Setup

YAMS will use the usual `$MPD_HOST` and `$MPD_PORT` environment variables to connect to `mpd`, if they exist.
Beyond that it looks for a configuration file named `yams.yml` placed in `$HOME/.config/yams` or `$HOME/.yams`
You can auto-generate this file by running the script with the `-g` flag. Note that the initial config generated by `-g` won't include the `log_file` field, but you can always add that if need be.

**Warning: You should create the `$HOME/.config/yams` or `$HOME/.yams` directories yourself. If not, the `session_file` (storing your saved session info) and log file will be saved in the current directory.**

You **need** to add an `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` from Last.FM to the configuration file, or to the program's command line parameters, before running. Emphasis on *need*. Generate them [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) if you haven't done so already.

Once run, it'll guide you through the authentication process and save its credentials to the same folder as its config.

***TL;DR: Run `mkdir -p ~/.config/yams` then run `yams -g` to bootstrap everything.***

#### Help

Sorry for the not-so flushed out README, the program should be rather self explanatory.

Here's the output for `--help`:

```
usage: YAMS [-h] [-m 127.0.0.1] [-p 6600] [-s ./.lastfm_session]
            [--api-key wdoqwnd10j2903j013r] [--api-secret oegnapj390rj2q]
            [-t 50] [-r] [-d] [-c ~/my_config] [-g] [-l /path/to/log]

Yet Another Mpd Scrobbler. Configuration directories are either
~/.config/yams, ~/.yams, or your current working directory. Create one of
these paths if need be.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m 127.0.0.1, --mpd-host 127.0.0.1
                        Your MPD instance's host
  -p 6600, --mpd-port 6600
                        Your MPD instance's port
  -s ./.lastfm_session, --session-file-path ./.lastfm_session
                        Where to read in/save your session file to. Defaults
                        to inside your config directory.
  --api-key wdoqwnd10j2903j013r
                        Your last.fm api key
  --api-secret oegnapj390rj2q
                        Your last.fm api secret
  -t 50, --scrobble-threshold 50
                        The minimum point at which to scrobble, defaults to 50
                        percent
  -r, --real-time       Use real times when calculating scrobble times? (e.g.
                        how long you've been running the app, not the track
                        time reported by mpd). Default: True
  -d, --allow-duplicate-scrobbles
                        Allow the program to scrobble the same track multiple
                        times in a row? Default: False
  -c ~/my_config, --config ~/my_config
                        Your config to read
  -g, --generate-config
                        Automatically save/update a configuration file. Good
                        for bootsrapping.
  -l /path/to/log, --log-file /path/to/log
                        Full path to a log file. If not set, a log file called
                        "yams.log" will be placed in the current config
                        directory.
                        ```
